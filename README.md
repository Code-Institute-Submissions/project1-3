# 60's Rock Band Website Project

A simple website for a 60s rock band
 
## UX

The goal of the website is to allow the fans to see photos of the band, connect with them on social platforms, get some more backstory and check their availibility to perform on weddings and such.

## Features

- allows users to play media files directly from the website, this ensures that the files are always available as long as the website is functional.
- users can hover over each of the bottom images, revealing the assiociated artist's name and image color.
- 
 
### Existing Features

Allows the user to see appropriate content when clicking appropriate link

### Features Left to Implement
- Availibility 'calendar' could be implemented in Javascript, fetching availibity data from a text file that would be easier to edit than directly in the html file.

## Technologies Used

- HTML (https://www.w3.org/)
- CSS (https://www.w3.org/)
- Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/)
- Javascript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)


## Testing

1. Checked if content is accessible in both desktop and mobile versions.
2. All links working correctly
3. Images on the bottom change color when you mouseover them, they also display name tooltip.

After deploying the project to Github Pages some media files won't load. Might be temporary (https://taigatenori.github.io/project1/index.html)

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
